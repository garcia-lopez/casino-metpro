# Casino Game Project - Roulette in C++

## Overview
This project was my first programming endeavor, developed in **C++**, where I created a console-based adaptation of the **Roulette game** as part of a larger casino game project. The goal was to simulate the gameplay and mechanics of Roulette in a simple and interactive console environment.

## Features
- **Bet Options**: Implementation of various bet types, such as:
  - Straight (single number)
  - Split (two numbers)
  - Red or Black
  - Odd or Even
- **Randomized Outcomes**: Ensured fairness and unpredictability using random number generation to simulate spins.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: Clear and concise prompts guide players through the game.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Development Environment**: Console-based application

## Key Responsibilities
- Adapted the traditional Roulette game into a fully functional **console version**.
- Designed the game mechanics, including bet types and payout logic.
- Ensured user-friendly interaction and a seamless gaming experience.

## Lessons Learned
This project introduced me to fundamental programming concepts such as:
- **Control Structures**: Loops and conditionals for game flow.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays for managing bets and outcomes.
- **Randomization**: Leveraging built-in functions to generate random results.
- **Problem-Solving**: Translating a real-world game into a digital format.

## Purpose
The project was a stepping stone in my programming journey, combining creativity and technical skills to develop a fun and engaging application. It sparked my passion for coding and problem-solving through practical applications.
